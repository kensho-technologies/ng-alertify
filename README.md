[Demo](http://kensho.github.io/ng-alertify/)

## Install and use

`npm install ng-alertify --save` or `bower install ng-alertify`.
Include the `dist/ng-alertify.js` and `dist/ng-alertify/css` files in your page and
use `Alertify` module and dependency

```js
angular.module('MyApp', ['Alertify'])
  .run(function (Alertify) {
    // these messages disappear after a few seconds
    Alertify.success('Hello world!');
    Alertify.log('Neutral message');
    Alertify.error('Something went wrong',
    'multiple params, including errors', new Error('are ok'));

    // these modals require user to close them
    Alertify.alert('Hi there');
    // displays "Something went wrong multiple params, including errors are ok"
    Alertify.confirm('Are you sure?').then(
        function onOk() {...},
        function onCancel() { ... }
    );
    Alertify.prompt('Your age', 21).then(
        function onOk(answer) {...},
        function onCancel() { ... }
    );
    // Pops dialog with JSON of the object
    Alertify.json(object);
  });
```

Tested with [alertify.js](http://fabien-d.github.io/alertify.js/) v0.3.11

Works well with [confirm-click](https://github.com/bahmutov/confirm-click).
